title: The Tectonic Project: Envisioning a 21st-century <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> experience
keynote: yes
timezone: -0400
time: 2022-07-22T15:15:00Z
abstract: Tectonic is a software project built around an alternative <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> engine forked from <span class="xetex">X<span>&#398;</span>T<span>e</span>X</span>. It was created to explore the answers to two questions.  The first question relates to documents: in a world of 21st-century technologies– where interactive displays, computation, and internet connectivity are generally cheap and ubiquitous– what new forms of technical document have become possible? The second question relates to tools: how can we use those same technologies to do a better job of empowering people to create excellent technical documents? The answers are, of course, intertwined: without a system of great tools, it’s hard (or perhaps impossible?) to create great documents.  <br /><br /> The premises of the Tectonic project are that the world needs and deserves a “21st-century” document authoring system, that such a system should have <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> at its heart– and that in order to create a successful system, parts of the classic <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> experience will need to be rethought or jettisoned completely.  <br /><br /> This is why Tectonic forks <span class="xetex">X<span>&#398;</span>T<span>e</span>X</span> and is branded independently: while it aspires to maintain compatibility with classic <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> workflows as far as can be managed, in a certain sense the whole point of the effort is to break compatibility and ignore tradition– to experiment with new ideas that can’t be tried in mainline <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span>. Thus far, these “new ideas” have focused on experience design, seeking to deliver a system that is convenient, empowering, and even delightful for users and developers. Tectonic is therefore compiled using standard Rust tools, installs as a single executable file, and downloads support files from a prebuilt <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> Live distribution on demand.  <br /><br /> In the past year, long-threatened work on native <span class="sm-caps">HTML</span> output has finally started landing, including a possibly novel Unicode math rendering scheme based on font subsetting. The goal for upcoming work is to flesh out this <span class="sm-caps">HTML</span> support so that Tectonic can create the world’s best web-native technical documents, and to use that support to document the Tectonic system itself.

title: The future of technical documentation starts with its <i>recent</i> past
keynote: yes
timezone: -0400
time: 2022-07-22T16:00:00Z
abstract: This keynote presentation will address how recent trends to align technical documentation practices with “developer-friendly” workflows may be detrimental to documentation authors and their users. A proposed solution is in the recent past of technical documentation as a discipline, where tools and ideas rooted in structured authoring and markup, reuse, and personalization can still provide solutions to present– and future– needs related to technical content.

timezone: -0700
time: 2022-07-22T18:15:00Z
abstract: Playing chess can range from a casual pastime to a highly competitive event. Several local organizations offer chess as enrichment programs in K&nbsp;12 schools, often having their own workbooks to supplement their instruction. One drawback is that these workbooks are often created using screen captures of online sources, hence resulting in low-quality outputs when used for print. This exploration tours a few packages used for typesetting diagrams for chess problems and puzzles and presents comparisons of one enrichment program’s original workbook to equivalent pages produced using <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span>.

keynote: yes
timezone: -0400
time: 2022-07-22T22:15:00Z
abstract: Who wins? The base or the superstructure? I’m not a Marxist per se, but I’ve lived this struggle for some time as a writer and publisher. In this keynote presentation, I describe my efforts to change or adapt the democratized tools of production to produce new forms of writing, which ultimately led to an ongoing battle with the dominant cultures of production in the world of publishing. I’ll narrate two case studies. One focuses on the writing and production of an innovative, if not disruptive, textbook in the ultra-conservative textbook industry. The second tells the ongoing story of an interloping publishing company (Parlor Press) that reveals the central challenge of <i>distribution</i> for both writers and publishers, from typesetting (print) to transformation (digital). <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span> developers and users, take note!

timezone: -0700
time: 2022-07-23T01:30:00Z
abstract: One of Knuth’s important insights was the concept of literate programming, where the prose is as important as the code. Now many scientists in different fields are having similar insights about their work. While the published papers have been always recognized as the works of literature, now we start to understand this with respect to lab notes, the lowly reports of our daily activity. This explains the new interest to notebook interfaces: from commercial programs like Matlab and Mathematica to free systems like Wxmaxima and Jupyter.  <br /><br /> In this talk I discuss the approach that uses <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span> and <tt>knitr</tt> for creating lab notes. I compare it with the available notebook interfaces and the the solutions based on Markdown.

title: Boxes and glue: <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> algorithms reimplemented
timezone: +0200
time: 2022-07-23T11:15:00Z
abstract: <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> (and therefore <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span>) have enjoyed great popularity over the years as an extremely flexible, versatile, and robust text typesetting system. The flexibility comes not least from the ability to modify the behavior of <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> through programming and from Knuth’s foresight in recognizing the individual elements on the page as small, rectangular building blocks that can be combined into larger units and also manipulated (box).  <br /><br /> The development of Lua<span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> made modern applications possible for the first time in the long history of <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> via some extensions: </p> <div class="row"> <div class="column"> <ul> <li> The number of characters in fonts is no longer limited to 256. This eliminates crutches like output encoding. </li> <li> Through the integration of HarfBuzz a solid “shaper” is available. This allows OpenType features and complicated writing systems (e.g., Arabic) to be output without any problems. </li> <li> The system can be programmed with Lua instead of the built-in macro language. </li> <li> Due to the clever <span class="sm-caps">PDF</span> support, almost all <span class="sm-caps">PDF</span> properties and standards can be supported. </li> </ul> </div> </div> <p> I use these extensions for the program ‘speedata Publisher”, which is mainly made for the fully automatic creation of product catalogs and data sheets from <span class="sm-caps">XML</span>.  <br /><br /> Despite all the achievements of <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> and Lua<span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span>, there are still serious disadvantages: </p> <div class="row"> <div class="column"> <ul> <li> <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> and Lua<span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> are anything but modular. Changing single areas is especially difficult, because <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> is not designed for that. </li>  <li> Some things cannot be achieved with Lua<span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span>’s on-board tools. For example, <span class="sm-caps">HTTPS</span> requests require an external library. Documents in our catalog area often get their images from image databases that are accessed via <span class="sm-caps">HTTPS</span>. </li> <li> For other tasks, too, it is better to use an external library than to reinvent the wheel. For example, an <span class="sm-caps">XML</span> parser or a library for bidirectional text typesetting. </li>  <li> Parallelization of tasks: modern processors usually have several processor cores, which lie idle with <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span>. Several tasks in <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> could be executed in parallel. Paragraphs could be wrapped with different parameters and then the best one selected. Loading font files and preparing them for subsetting in <span class="sm-caps">PDF</span> does not have to be done sequentially. <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> does not provide such facilities. </li>  <li> Distributing Lua<span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> binaries across platforms is difficult due to external dependencies. For single applications you don’t want to ship or require a whole <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> Live installation. </li> </ul> </div> </div> <p> The restrictions mentioned have disturbed me considerable. Regarding the output quality of <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span>, there are hardly comparable alternatives– especially not in the opensource area. Therefore, there seemed no alternative left but to re-implement <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> in a “modern” programming language. Some years ago there was already such an attempt (<span class="sm-caps">NTS</span>), but it failed. After long pondering, respectively to meet my requirements for a text typesetting system for catalogs and datasheets, I came to the conclusion that I “only” take over the algorithms and the logic of <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span>, but not the input language.  <br /><br /> </p> <h2>Boxes and glue</h2> <br /><br /> <p> “Boxes and glue” is a library written in the Go programming language.  The name is based on the model of <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> with the stretchable spaces between the rectangular units. The development of boxes and glue is quite advanced and includes among other things: </p> <div class="row"> <div class="column"> <ul> <li> <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span>’s smallest units (node) with ways to nest them inside each other (vbox, hbox). </li> <li> <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span>’s paragraph breaking algorithm. </li>  <li> The pattern-based hyphenation. </li> <li> The inclusion of TrueType and OpenType fonts and <span class="sm-caps">PNG</span>, <span class="sm-caps">JPEG</span>, and <span class="sm-caps">PDF</span> images. </li>  <li> Text shaping with HarfBuzz. </li> </ul> </div> </div> <p> Besides these basic parts, there is yet another library that builds on <tt>boxesandglue</tt>. It offers: </p> <div class="row"> <div class="column"> <ul> <li> Reading <span class="sm-caps">XML</span> files </li> <li> Interpretation of <span class="sm-caps">HTML</span> and <span class="sm-caps">CSS</span> </li> <li> grouping of font files into families with easy font selection </li> <li> Handling of colors of all kinds (<span class="sm-caps">RGB</span>, <span class="sm-caps">CMYK</span>, spot colors) </li> <li> Tagged <span class="sm-caps">PDF</span> </li> </ul> </div> </div> <p> The application programming interface (<span class="sm-caps">API</span>) is not yet fixed. The development of boxes and glue is being carried out in parallel with the further development of the <a href="https://github.com/speedata/xts">speedata Publisher</a> and the requirements here largely determine the programming interface of <tt>boxesandglue</tt>.  Since it is a library, there is no fixed input language as with <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span>. In this respect also, <tt>boxesandglue</tt> is also yet suitable for and (end) user.  <br /><br /> <h2>References</h2> </p> <div class="row"> <div class="column"> <ul> <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Typesetting_System">NTS</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/speedata/boxesandglue">Boxes and glue</a> </li>  <li> <a href="https://github.com/speedata/publisher">speedata Publisher</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/speedata/xts">XTS XML</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div>

abstract: This paper describes the development and usage of the <tt>luatruthtable</tt> package in <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span>. It is developed to generate truth tables of boolean values in a <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span> document. The package provides an easy way of generating truth tables in <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span>. There is no need of special environment in <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span> in the package for the generation of truth tables. It is written in Lua and <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> file is to be compiled with Lua<span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span> engine.  <br /><br /> The Lua programming language is a scripting language which can be embedded across platforms. With Lua<span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> and the <tt>luacode</tt> package, it is possible to use Lua in <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span>. All<span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> have some scope for programming, but with the internals of <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> there are several limitations especially for performing calculations. Packages like <tt>pgf</tt> and <tt>xparse</tt> in <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span> provide some programming capabilities inside <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span> documents, but such packages are not meant to provide the complete programming structure that general programming languages, like Lua, provide.  <br /><br /> The generation of truth tables with these packages in <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span> became complex, and probably without using Lua it can’t be done in an easier way in <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span>. The programming capabilities of Lua are effectively used in the development of <tt>luatruthtable</tt> package. The <tt>xkeyval</tt> package is used in its development, in addition to the <tt>luacode</tt> package. The time needed for generation of truth tables using the package and compilation of a <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> document with Lua<span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> is not an issue.

Much has changed both in the <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> community and in the wider world over that time.  <br /><br /> <span class="sm-caps">UK TUG</span> was a significant part of the <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> community. Besides myself (Jonathan Fine), former members of <span class="sm-caps">UK TUG</span> include Peter Abbott, Kaveh Bazargan, David Carlisle, Paulo Cereda, Malcolm Clark, David Crossland, Robin Fairbairns, Alan Jeffrey, Sebastian Rahtz, Arthur Rosendahl, Chris Rowley, Philip Taylor and Joseph Wright.  <br /><br /> This list includes two past Presidents of <span class="sm-caps">TUG</span>, the current Vice President and a past Secretary.  Ten people on the list served on the <span class="sm-caps">TUG</span> Board, for a total of over 30 years.  <br /><br /> Five are or were members of the <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span>3 project. One was the founder and for 8 years editor of <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span>Live, and another the Technical coordinator of the <span class="sm-caps">NTS</span> project. One is a Lead Program Manager for Google Fonts.  <br /><br /> This talk provides a personal history from <tt>\begin{uktug}</tt> to <tt>\end{uktug}</tt>, with a short ‘<tt>\aftergroup</tt>’ appendix.

time: 2022-07-24T01:45:00Z
links: http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~ross/TaggedPDF/TUG2022/
abstract: Some basic requirements for Accessibility of tabular material are:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="column"> <ul> <li> each cell, whether header or content, must have an attribute providing a unique ID for that cell; </li> <li> each data cell must specify the corresponding row and column headers that most directly provide the meaning of the information contained within the cell.  This is done via a <span class="sans-serif">Headers</span> attribute using the unique IDs for the header cells. </li> </ul> </div> </div> <p> Header cells themselves may have other row or column headers; e.g., as a common header for a block of rows or columns.  <br /> <br /> Tagged PDF has the tagging and mechanisms to provide such attributes.  When the PDF is translated into HTML (using the  <span class="sans-serif">ngPDF</span> online converter, say) this information is recorded in the web-pages, to be available to Assistive Technologies.  In this talk we show several examples of tables specified using various packages, as in the <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span> Companion, both in PDF and HTML web pages.  A novel coding idea that allows this to be achieved will be presented.

The described algorithms are used in various <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> packages such as <tt>footmisc</tt>, <tt>fnpara</tt>, <tt>manyfoot</tt>, and many others.  <br /><br /> When the package <tt>multicol</tt> is used, things get more complicated.  Another level of complication arises when you want to mix these with both right to left and left to right typesetting.  <br /><br /> The <tt>bidi</tt> package provides both right to left and left to right multi-columns and paragraph footnotes.  <br /><br /> This talk will describe my own experience learning about how other packages implement multi-columns and paragraph footnotes, and also the approach I took in the <tt>bidi</tt> package for typesetting right to left and left to right multi-columns and paragraph footnotes.

Specifically, we present: </p> <div class="row"> <div class="column"> <ol> <li> The s<span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> package that allows declaring semantic macros and provides a module system for organizing and importing semantic macros using logical identifiers. Semantic macros allow for annotating arbitrary LaTeX fragments, particularly symbolic notations and formulae, with their functional structure and formal semantics while keeping their presentation/layout intact. The module system induces a “theory graph”-structure on mathematical concepts, reflecting their dependencies and other semantic relations. </li> <li> The Rus<span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> system, an implementation of the core <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> engine in Rust. Generally Rus<span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span> allows for converting arbitrary <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span> documents to <span class="sm-caps">XHTML</span>. For s<span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span>3 documents, these are enriched with semantic annotations based on the flexiformal <span class="sm-caps">OMD</span>oc ontology. </li> <li> An <span class="sm-caps">MMT</span> integration: The Rus<span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span>-generated <span class="sm-caps">XHTML</span> can be imported and served by the <span class="sm-caps">MMT</span> system for semantically-informed knowledge management services, e.g., linking symbols in formulae to their definition or “guided tour” mini-courses for any (semantically annotated) mathematical concept/object. </li> </ol> </div> </div> <p>Generally, s<span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span>3 documents can be made not only interactive (by embedding semantic services), but also “active” in that they actively adapt to reader preferences and pre-knowledge (if known).

Here, I will look briefly at the background, then explore how to use the new mechanism in package development.

The system combines a <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span> parser, tokenization of math and labels, a deep learning Transformer model trained on mathematical and other text, and the Google Translate <span class="sm-caps">API</span> with a custom glossary. Ablation testing shows that math tokenization and the Transformer model each significantly improve translation quality, while Google Translate is used as a backup when the Transformer does not have confidence in its translation. For <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span> parsing, we have used the pandoc document converter, while our latest development version instead uses the TexSoup package. We will describe the system, show examples, and discuss future directions.

Here’s another illustration.  <br /><br /> Jonathan Godfrey, a blind Senior Lecturer in Statistics in New Zealand wrote to the Blind Math list “I used to use <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span>4ht as my main tool for getting <span class="sm-caps">HTML</span> from <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span> source. This was and probably still is, an excellent tool. How much traction does it get though? Not much. Why?  I don’t know, but my current theory is that tools that aren’t right under people’s noses or automatically applied in the background just don’t get as much traction.” (<a href="https://nfbnet.org/pipermail/blindmath_nfbnet.org/2021-January/009641.html">Reference</a>) <br /><br /> Jonathan Godfrey also wrote to the BlindMath list “Something has to change in the very way people use <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span> if we are ever to get truly accessible pdf documents. I’ve laboured the point that we need access to information much more than we need access to a specific file format, and I’ll keep doing so.
