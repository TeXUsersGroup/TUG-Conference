In general, we get from the author a text that is already
in pidginTeX, or a full TeX file as in 

      moore-tables.tex

Cleaning it up from most opening and closing material we 
can leave the essential part in a .txt file as in:

      moore-tables.txt

Which can then be converted, using the small TeX to HTML 
sed translator:

    sed -f trans.sed moore-tables.txt > moore-tables.html

One can then eliminate all NEWLINES to produce:

      moore-tables-ready.html

which is ready to be included in the "pres.dat" file and
then have the program generated by

      node make-schedule.js

From this point on, unless the changes are really major,
all the editing of the Abstracts should be done inside 
pres.dat database. A copy of the small abstract should 
be kept for major changes.

The "abstract" has to be written as a one-liner into the "pres.dat"
file and

If there are more than one paragraph, they should be broken in two BR,
that is

    <br /> <br />


If there are lists (ordered or unordered, they have to be held inside
the structure of the <div>'s below:


      <div class="panel">
      <p>
      In this talk I will present two packages:</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
               <ul>
                  <li>tagpdf which contains the core....</li>
                  <li>pdfmanagement-testphase which contains a large .....</li>
               </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>I will show how to use these packages...
      </p>
      </div>

and outside <p> tags.
