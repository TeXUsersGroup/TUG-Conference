Some basic requirements for Accessibility of tabular material are:
\begin{itemize}
\item each cell, whether header or content, must have an attribute providing a unique ID for that cell;
\item each data cell must specify the corresponding row and column headers that most directly provide the meaning of the information contained within the cell.  This is done via a \textsf{Headers} attribute using the unique IDs for the header cells.
\end{itemize}

Header cells themselves may have other row or column headers; e.g., as a common header for a block of rows or columns.

Tagged PDF has the tagging and mechanisms to provide such attributes.
When the PDF is translated into HTML (using the  \textsf{ngPDF} online converter, say) this information
is recorded in the web-pages, to be available to Assistive Technologies.
In this talk we show several examples of tables specified using various packages, as in the \LaTeX\ Companion,
both in PDF and HTML web pages. 
A novel coding idea that allows this to be achieved will be presented.
