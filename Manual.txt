Utilities
---------
trans.sed   --> Sed script used to translate pidgin-TeX in abstracts to HTML.


----------------

All text is entered in UTF-8, titles and abstracts should
be entered in HTML. The fields are:


pres:
author:
title:
timezone:
time:
abstract:
sources:
slides:
link:
preprint:
video:
---------
The entries "author", "slides", "sources", "link", "preprint"
and "video" can be multiple, with each entry separated by comma.

We do not have a way, currently, to associate two different TZs
for different authors. The TZ to be used will be of the person
preferably given the talk.

All fields are one-liners, including the abstract. If a newline
is necessary use the <p> tag.

An example is:

--------
pres: guichard-ltxworkshop
author: Éric Guichard,Jean-Michel Hufflen
title: LaTeX workshop in French
timezone: +0200
time: 2022-07-21T13:00:00Z
slides: assets/pdf/Éric_Guichard-TUG2022-Workshop-Slides.pdf,assets/pdf/J.-M._Hufflen-TUG2022-Workshop-Slides.pdf
sources: assets/pdf/Éric_Guichard.tar.gz,assets/pdf/hufflen-demo.tar.gz,assets/pdf/hufflen-main.tex.gz,assets/pdf/hufflen-t.tex.gz
abstract: An atelier de LaTex en Français.
---------

The format for the breaks is:

---------
pres: break
time: 2022-07-21T22:00:00Z
title: Break,
---------

Right now the comma after the word "Break" in the title is required.
We hope to fix that soon.

The way to enter the Poshlets TeX, LaTeX, XeTeX and XeLaTeX are:

       <span class="tex">T<span>e</span>X</span>
       
       <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span>
       
       <span class="xetex">X<span>&#398;</span>T<span>e</span>X</span>
       
To enter acronyms, use Small Caps:

       <span class="sm-caps">PDF</span>
